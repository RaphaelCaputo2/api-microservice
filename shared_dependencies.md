1. Node.js: Both the API gateway and the microservice will be built using Node.js, so they will share this dependency.

2. Express.js: This is a Node.js web application framework that will be used in both the API gateway and the microservice for routing and middleware.

3. RabbitMQ: This is a message broker that will be used for communication between the API gateway and the microservice. Both will share the RabbitMQ helper file.

4. User Routes: Both the API gateway and the microservice will have a userRoutes.js file, which will define the routes for CRUD operations on users.

5. User Controller: Both the API gateway and the microservice will have a userController.js file, which will contain the logic for handling user-related requests.

6. User Model: This will be used in the microservice to define the data schema for a user.

7. User Service: This will be used in the microservice to handle business logic related to users.

8. Request Validation Middleware: This will be used in the API gateway to validate incoming requests.

9. Server.js: Both the API gateway and the microservice will have a server.js file, which will be the entry point for each application.

10. Package.json: Both the API gateway and the microservice will have a package.json file, which will list the project dependencies.

11. Config.js: This will be used in the microservice to configure the database connection.

12. CRUD Operations: Both the API gateway and the microservice will share the same CRUD operation names (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for users.

13. Message Names: The names of the messages sent via RabbitMQ will be shared between the API gateway and the microservice.

14. DOM Elements: As these are backend services, there will be no shared DOM elements.
